## Coding assignment instructions
  
### Setup steps:
- Set up the project in your preferred IDE, using Maven.

### Guidelines:
- Do not add any additional libraries, than are already defined in the pom.xml

### Disclaimer:
- All data, names and dates used in this exercise are made up. Any resemblance to real-life data is a coincidence.
 
### Assignment:
1. Write appropriate code to make all tests in the class ScheduleImplTest pass. In order to do this you might have to create new and change existing classes.
2. Add a JUnit test for the functionality that generates the "3 months ago" string used in ScheduleImplTest.getScheduleForAllInterviewsInThePast. The JUnit test should provide a good coverage of the functionality.
  
#### Have fun and good luck!
